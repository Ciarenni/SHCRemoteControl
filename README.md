# SHCRemoteControl
Tool for remotely manipulating the radio and rotator

This tool was created to allow for controlling the radio frequency and antenna rotator when not physically present at those devices. The idea was that members of the club could remote into the computer that was connected to the devices and control them, allowing us to listen to time-sensitive passes of satellites in orbits without having to rush over to the building with the radio equipment.

It's been years since I touched this and I don't have access to the database or schema that I was apparently using. I'm not entirely sure what I was doing with the database I was hitting, and it looks like whatever I was trying to do, I did it incredibly poorly. Best guess is I created a token concept so that if someone was physically present at the controls, they could deactivate the remote antenna control so the program and the person weren't fighting each other and burning out the motor.
